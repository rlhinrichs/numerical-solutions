These projects utilize Python's NumPy and SciPy libraries alone to demonstration solution techniques, and Matplotlib to demonstrate the solutions graphically.

<h3>Systems of Linear Equations</h3>
<p></p>
Four projects explore numerical methods in the solution of systems of linear equations.
<p></p>
- <b>HW1</b>: <br>
- <b>HW2</b>: <br>
- <b>HW3</b>: <br>
- <b>HW4</b>: <br>
<p></p>
<h3>Partial Differential Equations</h3>
<p></p>
Two projects explore numerical methods in the solution of differential equations.
<p></p>
- <b>HW5</b>: exploring solutions to second-order boundary value problems <br>
-- First Central Difference Method <br>
-- Finite Difference Method <br>
-- Newton-Raphson Iterative Method <br>
<p></p>
- <b>HW6</b>: exploring solutions to elliptical, parabolic, and hyperbolic partial differential equations
<p></p>
-- Finite Difference Method <br>
-- Gauss-Seidel Iterative Method <br>
-- Forward-Difference Method (Forward-Time Central Space Scheme) <br>
-- Backward-Difference Method <br> 
<p></p>
<h1>Footnote</h1>

I thoroughly enjoyed these projects, and was anxious to record all of my findings, as a student transitioning from her senior year in Data Science to her graduate studies in Artificial Intelligence. I saw so many patterns unfolding between all of my studies and felt these projects truly gave me a peek into the Pandora's box of representing physical continuums into discretized approaches which seem translatable to so many interdisciplinary mysteries, it was truly invigorating! That said, I haven't had time to iron out my commentary either in Markdown or in the structure of the coding itself to make it as explicit (ha) as I'd like quite yet. But as a labor of love, I hope to return to this either here or in future projects :)
